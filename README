  What is it?
  -----------

  flyReaper predicts times of death of flies in a 96 well place.  It takes an
  output file from flyMultiPlateScript.m (the main matlab script of the
  [flyMultiPlate package](https://github.com/hepcat72/flyMultiPlate)).
  flyMultiPlate is a fly motion tracker.  flyReaper finds the first instance of
  N contiguous occurrences of a stationary value and reports the inferred time
  of death for each well.
